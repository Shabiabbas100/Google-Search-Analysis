## Motivation behind the project

Every day, billions of people rely on Google for their searches, making it the most visited website globally. In recent years, Google has consistently recorded tens of billions of visits annually, reflecting its massive reach and influence which is quite interesting.

Google processes over 8.5 billion searches per day (Internetlivestats, 2025).

For that matter, Google becomes a use case for analyzing data based on search queries.
